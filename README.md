This project focuses on the energy efficiency of residential buildings, and more particularly on heating and cooling needs, according to architectural features such as wall surface, glazed area, orientation, etc. 
The dataset used contains eight attributes describing its features for 768 buildings and 2 target attributes: the heating loads and the cooling loads of these buildings.
Our purpose is to predict the charges for each building, according to its attributes.
